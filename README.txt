🌐 Secure CRUD Web Application

Welcome to the Secure CRUD Web Application! 🚀

✨ Overview

This is a beautifully crafted web application that ensures secure user authentication with session-based token management. Users are welcomed by a Login Page and can only access the Home Page upon successful authentication. If the session token is deleted or expired, users are instantly redirected back to the Login Page. 🔒

🌟 Features

🔐 Secure Authentication: Users must log in to access the application.

🕒 Session-Based Security: Session tokens validate user sessions; without them, users are logged out automatically.

📊 Dynamic Data Table: The Home Page showcases a responsive and interactive data table.

✏️ CRUD Operations:

-  Add ➕ new data entries.

-  Update 🔄 existing records.

-  Delete ❌ unwanted entries.

-  🌐 JSONPlaceholder Integration: The app utilizes the JSONPlaceholder API, allowing temporary data modifications. Please note: changes are not persistent and will reset upon page reload.

-  🚀 Hosted on Vercel: The app is seamlessly deployed and accessible anytime, anywhere.
